The server has a number of global objects that are available to all clients.  These objects typically represent an actual object in the server (for example, an input device) or they are singleton objects that provide extension functionality.When a client creates a registry object, the registry object will emit a global event for each global currently in the registry.  Globals come and go as a result of device or monitor hotplugs, reconfiguration or other events, and the registry will send out global and global_remove events to keep the client up to date with the changes.  To mark the end of the initial burst of events, the client can use the wl_display.sync request immediately after calling wl_display.get_registry.A client can bind to a global object by using the bind request.  This creates a client-side handle that lets the object emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on the object."]]});
