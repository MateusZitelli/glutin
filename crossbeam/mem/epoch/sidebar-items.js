It is rentrant -- you can safely acquire nested guards, and only the first guard requires a barrier. Thus, in cases where you expect to perform several lock-free operations in quick succession, you may consider pinning around the entire set of operations."]],"struct":[["Atomic","Like `std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr`.Provides atomic access to a (nullable) pointer of type `T`, interfacing with the `Owned` and `Shared` types."],["Guard","An RAII-style guard for pinning the current epoch.A guard must be acquired before most operations on an `Atomic` pointer.
